const int blinkLED = 27;    // assign digital pin 27 for the LED to blink
const int onTime=1000;      // duration of LED to stay ON in milli-seconds
const int offTime=1000;     // duration of LED to stay OFF in milli-seconds

// setup code goes here, to run once:
void setup() {
  pinMode(blinkLED , OUTPUT);
}


// the main code which runs repeatedly:
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(blinkLED, HIGH);   // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(onTime);                       // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(blinkLED, LOW);    // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(offTime);                       // wait for a second
}
```

## Conclusion
Defining constant (const) variable allows us to control the rest of the code without changing much to get different results. For example we change blinkLED variable to any other pin depending on the board (ESP32, Arduino UNO, ESP8266 ...).  Also one can try fiddling with onTime and offTime variable to see different results.
