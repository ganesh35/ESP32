# Testing MQTT Functionality

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) broker receives all messages from the clients (Publishers) and then routes the messages to the appropriate destination clients (Subscribers).

An MQTT client is any device (from a micro controller up to a fully-fledged server) that runs an MQTT library and connects to an MQTT broker over a network.
